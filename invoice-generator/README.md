# Invoice Generator <br />

## Overview

I created this application as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I learnt about -

- **CSS styling**
- **Working with event listeners in JavaScript**
- **Rendering HTML on screen from JavaScript**
- **Working independently to complete a porgramming task**
