#  Password Generator <br />

## Overview

I created this application as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I learnt about -

- **CSS Styling**
- **Working with queory selectors in JavaScript**
- **Selecting random indexes in an array**
- **Copying data to the clipboard from the browser**
