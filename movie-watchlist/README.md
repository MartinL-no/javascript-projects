# Movie Watchlist <br />

## Overview

I created this site as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I developed skills in -

- **Using browser local storage to persist data across webpages**
- **Using the JavaScript window object to load data from local storage on site opening**
- **Using template literals in JavaScript**
- **CSS styling**

## Features

- The app consist of two pages, a searchpage and page where the user can view/ remove films from their watchlist

- User can search for their favourite films using keyword which seaches the [Open Movie Database](https://opentdb.com/) via JavaScript fetch/API call

- Search results are then dynamically rendered to the DOM where the user can add to his/her watchlist

- Watchlist data is saved to an array in local storage to allow the data to persist between the two webpages
