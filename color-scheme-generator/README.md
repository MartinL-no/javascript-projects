#  Color Scheme Generator <br />

## Overview

I created this application as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I learnt about things such as -

- **Querying REST API's using JavaScript Fetch/promises**
- **Working with HTML select and color picker elements**
- **Adding classes to HTML elements using the event object in JavaScript**
- **Importing and using CSS libraries**

## Features

- The app consist of one page

- The app allows the user to select a color and color scheme which is then retrieved from the [Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/)

- The data returned from the API is then mapped into an array and used to generate hex values and CSS color blocks in the DOM

- Hex value of each individual color can be copied to the clipboard by clicking the value, which activates a CSS animation of the text and alerts the user that they have copied it

## Tech Used / Dependencies

- [Animate.css]https://animate.style/ CSS animation library

- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) <br /><br />
