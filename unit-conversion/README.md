#  Unit Convertor <br />

## Overview

I created this application as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I learnt about things such as -

- **Recreating CSS styling of an application from Figma designs**
- **Extracting values/numbers from input fields and feeding them into Javascript functions**
- **Event triggers and how to use them with input fields**
- **Styling input fields and buttons**
- **Autoselecting fields on loadup**
- **Adding gradients in CSS**
- **Adding external fonts**
- **How to work out problems myself and find answers through the internet**
