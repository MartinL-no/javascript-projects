#  Sample Portfolio Site <br />

## Overview

I created this site as an assignment for the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

I was provided a [Figma](https://figma.com/) design and had to complete the task myself based on skills developed in the course using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From working on the project I developed skills in -

- **Creating a static website with a consistent style across multiple pages**
- **Creating responsive designs using CSS media queries**
- **Working with CSS grid/ flexbox**
- **Using CSS custom properties**
- **Using CSS animations**
